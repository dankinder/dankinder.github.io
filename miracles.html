        <p>It's understandable that we would doubt the existence of miracles.   </p>
        <p>After all, we want to be people who believe in facts and evidence, not some superstition.  I think there is this association in our minds - where we assume that if someone believes in miracles, then that person must belong to the category of gullible people who would believe in any tall tale...  But we need to be clear about this. Because someone who believes in miracles is NOT saying that miracles happen all the time..  They are not even saying that they themselves witnessed a bona fide miracle.  They are actually saying that miracles are POSSIBLE.  So that's the million dollar question - are miracles POSSIBLE?</p>
        <p>And this is where we run into something called an a priori decision – which is a decision made prior to a fair assessment of the evidence.
        For example, David Hume has famously said that it is unreasonable to EVER believe in miracles, no matter how much evidence.  That would be an a priori decision, and that's the first and biggest hurdle for people when thinking about belief in miracles. Here's an example.
        Let's say there is an ancient king..
        Who believed that the earth was flat, like everyone else around him.
        Then one day, a sailor comes to him with an astonishing claim.  The sailor says that his ship actually traveled west for 6 months, and after 6 months, he arrived back home.
        And the sailor shows this document – a detailed record of the ship's log – that shows that they DID travel west.  It has the star charts, it shows cross-referencing, and other witnesses on the ship saying that this is what happened...  In other words, document's authenticity is solid in every sense.
        Except 1 problem.  IF this document is true, then that means the earth is round!
        But you know what?  We already KNOW that the earth is not round!  It's flat.  That's why we stay on the ground.  It's ridiculous to believe that the earth is round.
        So.. Therefore, the king rejects the evidence.  It doesn't matter how strong it might be, or how many people were on the ship.   There MUST be something wrong with the evidence, and it's not really worth looking into.  As David Hume said, it is unreasonable to believe it, no matter how much evidence.</p>
        <p>So that's why having an a priori assumption is not good.  Because it prevents us from examining the evidence.   So... in the case with miracles...   
        If someone says: miracles are IMPOSSIBLE..  What is the underlying a priori assumption there?  In order to KNOW that there is no such thing as miracles in this entire universe,  
        One must pre-assume the NON-EXISTENCE of any HIGHER BEING 
        Because IF there is a higher being, such as God, then miracles are possible.   
        But if there isn't, then miracles are not possible.  Well, but that's not good..  
        Because how would you ever be convinced that the supernatural exists, if you already made up your mind that the supernatural cannot exist, and therefore will not entertain any evidence?   
        That's why we need to momentarily suspend our a priori assumptions and entertain the possibility.   </p>

        <p>At this point, someone might say: hey, isn't it the same thing for people who believe in miracles?  In order to believe in miracles, those people must have an a priori assumption that a supernatural being exists!   
        That's a good point, but if we think about it, I think we can see a subtle but very important difference.   
        Like I said in the beginning, people who believe in miracles are not saying miracles happen all the time.  I mean, if it did, then we would stop calling it a miracle, right?   
        They believe that miracles are POSSIBLE.   
        And in order to believe that..  
        No a priori decisions are necessary.  They don't have to have an a priori decision that the supernatural exists.  They don't have to believe that God exists. 
        hey merely have to open to the POSSIBILITY that a higher being exists, Then.. miracles are possible.  I think that's a more fair and open-minded position to hold, because then, we can become open toward evidence for miracles without any a priori commitment.  At least that's the starting point.   
        And that's what we have to decide as we think about this question.  Are we going to be open to the
        possibility?</p>

                Okay, I might be open to the theoretical possibility, but what kinds of evidence could there be that a miraculous event actually happened?

              <p>Well, the thing about miracles is that they are rare and unique by definition.  Also, They are exceptions to the laws of nature,
              so they're not reproducible or testable in the scientific sense.
              But if the claim is that a strange event still happened
              at such and such place and such and such time, in other words, at a point in history...
              Then there needs to be good historical evidence that holds up to scrutiny by the methods of historians, which cannot be simply repeated in a test-tube in a lab.  That's called
              historiography.  And that's what need to do with ANY event, including a report of an event that seems strange or inexplicable.. Such as a miracle.
              And perhaps the best example of a miraclulous event with well-attested historical evidence is the
              resurrection of Jesus.  So to answer your question – the kind of evidence that we need to look into for a
              miraculous event is HISTORICAL evidence.</p>

                      <p>Sounds good.  But now we're sort of going into another topic that is outside the scope of this question..  So I think I need to refer you to another person.

                      But let me just say: if you're going to be looking into the historical evidence for a miracle,

                      it makes sense that we investigate a very SIGNIFICANT miracle (or at least the claim of a miracle), like the resurrection of Jesus.  Because who cares if we become convinced that a supernatural event happened that didn't affect anyone, that no one really cares about??

                      BUT.. If the resurrection of Jesus really happened, THAT would be a pretty big deal.. And if it did NOT happen, then that would also be a big deal, because that would mean that all the Christians were wrong to believe it.

                      I encourage you to look into it.  I CAN tell you that there might be surprisingly legitimate evidence.. Strong enough so that many critics and historians who looked into it did get convinced by it.
                      If you're interested in finding out more about someone who searched into the evidence and got convinced - let me do a little plug here for a

                      movie from 2017 called The Case for Christ.  Might be worth watching.  Anyway, that's outside of
                      my field, so you should talk to my friend about that, if you're interested.   OR you can go back
                      and ask me more questions about this topic.</p>
